New details emerged in April 2017 in this Times account of James B. Comey\u2019s handling of the Clinton investigation, as well as in Mr. Comey\u2019s own book, published in April 2018.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Two inspectors general have asked the Justice Department to open an investigation into whether sensitive government information was mishandled in connection with the personal email account Hillary Rodham Clinton used as secretary of state, senior government officials said Thursday.\n\nThe request follows an assessment in a June 29 memo by the inspectors general for the State Department and the intelligence agencies that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s private account contained \u201chundreds of potentially classified emails.\u201d The memo was written to Patrick F. Kennedy, the under secretary of state for management.\n\nIt is not clear if any of the information in the emails was marked as classified by the State Department when Mrs. Clinton sent or received them.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/24/us/24emails/24emails-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/24/us/24emails/24emails-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=5ce78b6826f5333f8f743e1a7cdb374a196422219b535ec3f397a94a120b02db&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/24/us/24emails/24emails-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=5ce78b6826f5333f8f743e1a7cdb374a196422219b535ec3f397a94a120b02db&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michael S.
