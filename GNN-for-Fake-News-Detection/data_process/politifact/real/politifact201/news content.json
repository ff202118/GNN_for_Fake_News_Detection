Mario M. Cuomo quietly decided against suing the Federal Government to recover the costs of social services to illegal immigrants, rejecting for now a tactic chosen by Florida, California and Texas. He opted instead to negotiate with the Clinton Administration for reimbursement. He thus avoided a public debate that would put Mr. Cuomo, long a champion of immigrants, in the awkward position of portraying some as a drain on society.\n\n\"I want to negotiate with the Government instead for a lot of reasons,\" Mr. Cuomo said yesterday in an interview. \"And one of them is, frankly, that when you bring a lawsuit on this issue, it sends out the wrong message. I love immigrants. Legal, illegal -- they're not to be despised.\"\n\nLast week, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuiliani gave an even more spirited defense of illegal immigrants, virtually urging them to settle in New York City. Standing before television cameras, he criticized the growing hostility toward illegal immigrants across the country as simplistic and unsophisticated.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=1994", "https://s1.nyt.com/timesmachine/pages/1/1994/06/10/352888_360W.png?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=1994", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Deborah Sontag"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/10/nyregion/new-york-officials-welcome-immigrants-legal-or-illegal.html", "title": "New York Officials Welcome Immigrants, Legal or Illegal", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/10/nyregion/new-york-officials-welcome-immigrants-legal-or-illegal.html", "type": "article", "title": "New York Officials Welcome Immigrants, Legal or Illegal (Published 1994)", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=1994"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/10/nyregion/new-york-officials-welcome-immigrants-legal-or-illegal.html", "title": "New York Officials Welcome Immigrants, Legal or Illegal (Published 1994)", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png?year=1994", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/fbeaaa16-8d10-5ba3-904f-8945c6d1a077"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "article": {"published_time": "1994-06-10T05:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "1994-06-10T05:00:00.000Z", "section": "New York", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/deborah-sontag", "tag": "IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEES", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "articleid": 1994061000000352888, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/fbeaaa16-8d10-5ba3-904f-8945c6d1a077", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/f208dda6ff394798b93bfa09a7401df4", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=1994", "byl": "By Deborah Sontag", "news_keywords": "New York,NYC;New York City,Mario Cuomo,Rudolph W Giuliani,,", "pdate": 19940610, "CG": "nyregion", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/10/nyregion/new-york-officials-welcome-immigrants-legal-or-illegal.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/fbeaaa16-8d10-5ba3-904f-8945c6d1a077", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/10/nyregion/new-york-officials-welcome-immigrants-legal-or-illegal.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/10/nyregion/new-york-officials-welcome-immigrants-legal-or-illegal.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "slack-app-id": "A0121HXPPTQ"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 771224400.0, "source": "http://query.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
