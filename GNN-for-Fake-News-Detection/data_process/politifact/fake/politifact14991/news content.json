A native-born family, the Bordens ran a mill in what became the town for generations before and after the American revolution. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Later, at the end of the 19th Century a wave of immigrants swelled the town\u2019s population. Immigrants, however, never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180131064830im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/MelaniaSOTU1-200x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180131064830im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/Cruz131-200x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180131064830im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/Cory-Booker-1-200x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180131064830im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1-640x480.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180131064830im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/GettyImages-51376386-200x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180131064830im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/Joe-Kennedy-Mouth-CSPAN-200x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180131064830im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/CelebsSotuCantWatch-200x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180131064830im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17674108&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180131064830im_/https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=l2Y7o1IW1810vg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180131064830im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=296280873867140&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180131064830im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/GettyImages-912419464-200x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180131064830im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/dem-boo-200x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180131064830im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/trump-3-200x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180131064830im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/08/virginia-gov-Terry-McAuliffe-speaks-on-charlottesville-ap-200x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180131064830im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-dcxh5b8qxvs6g.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180131064830im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/image-4-200x150.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180131064830im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/wi/afp/30/o3mt1s_us-president-donald-trump-defend-his-economic-record-in-his-state-union-e1517362898730-200x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180131064830im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180131064830im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ian Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180131064830/http://www.breitbart.com/live/state-union-fact-check-analysis-livewire/fact-check-no-falls-river-massachusetts-was-not-built-by-immigrants/", "title": "Fact-Check: No, Fall River, Massachusetts, Was Not \u2018Built by Immigrants\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Rep.
