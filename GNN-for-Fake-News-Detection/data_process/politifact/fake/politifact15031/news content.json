To qualify for the federal disaster food assistance program, individuals must have lived or worked in one of the 48 declared counties on September 5, and NOT be a customer in the regular food assistance program,\u201d said DCF Communications Director Jessica Sims.\n\nSims added that DCF handed out D-SNAP benefits totaling more than $1 billion to 3.1 million people in the months following Hurricane Irma, but the state curtailed its D-SNAP benefit program on December 3.\n\nThe sharp decline in food stamp enrollment over one month reflects how states like Florida have curtailed their temporary food stamp benefit programs for those affected by natural disasters.\n\nBut it also highlights an ongoing downward trend in food stamp enrollment that has been going on for several years since state legislatures enacted welfare reform measures designed to get people back into the workforce.\n\nThe Trump administration announced that it would adopt some of these state welfare reform measures \u2014 such as requiring food stamp recipients to work a certain number of hours per week \u2014 and implement them at the federal level, causing nationwide food stamp enrollment to plunge even further.\n\nOver the past year since President Donald Trump took office, enrollment in SNAP dropped by two million. The latest food stamp numbers show that the downward trend over the past year \u2014 and every year after 2013 \u2014 is continuing.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180208150152im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/GettyImages-900129042-200x150.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180208150152im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/store-accepts-snap-ebt-food-stamps-file-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180208150152im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/orban-Hungary-First-200x150.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180208150152im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/Gaetz27-200x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180208150152im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/mitch-mcconnell-chuck-schumer-1-18-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180208150152im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/B-52-Stratofortress-military-exercises-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180208150152im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/store-accepts-snap-ebt-food-stamps-file-getty-640x480.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180208150152im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17674108&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180208150152im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/donald-trump-republican-national-committee-2-1-18-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180208150152im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/Daily-Life-At-A-Secondary-School-200x150.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180208150152im_/https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=l2Y7o1IW1810vg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180208150152im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/store-accepts-snap-ebt-food-stamps-file-getty.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180208150152im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-dcxh5b8qxvs6g.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180208150152im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/Pirro27-200x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180208150152im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/02/pakistani-valentines-day-getty-image-200x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180208150152im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/03/flower-left-in-tribute-1882-diaporama-200x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180208150152im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/10/GettyImages-181734298-200x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180208150152im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=296280873867140&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180208150152im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/store-accepts-snap-ebt-food-stamps-file-getty.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180208150152/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/02/07/food-stamp-enrollment-drops-4-million-one-month/", "title": "Food Stamp Enrollment Drops by Four Million in One Month", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in one month, according to the latest numbers on food stamp enrollment from the USDA.", "robots": "noodp", "keywords": "D-SNAP, enrollment, food stamps, Hurricane Irma, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, U.S. Department of Agriculture,Big Government, Economics, Pre-Viral,food stamp enrollment", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Food Stamp Enrollment Drops by Four Million in One Month - Breitbart", "description": "Four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in one month, according to the latest numbers on food stamp enrollment from the USDA.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180208150152/http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/02/07/food-stamp-enrollment-drops-4-million-one-month/", "site_name": "Breitbart", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180208150152im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/store-accepts-snap-ebt-food-stamps-file-getty.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "tag": "U.S. Department of Agriculture", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2018-02-07T22:28:13-08:00", "categories": "Big Government,Economics,Pre-Viral"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in one month, according to the latest numbers on food stamp enrollment from the USDA.", "title": "Food Stamp Enrollment Drops by Four Million in One Month - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180208150152im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/store-accepts-snap-ebt-food-stamps-file-getty.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.breitbart.com/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517932800.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
