Mr. Gonzalez was observed around 3:00 p.m. PDT wearing a jacket and walking \u201cout of the creek area and a plume of smoke behind him,\u201d according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMr. Gonzalez, who is homeless and reportedly known by law enforcement to have been living under a nearby bridge, claimed he was cold and had lit the fire to stay warm. But it was a balmy 78 degrees when he and the plume of smoke were first observed.\n\nMr. Gonzalez was booked into the Sonoma County Jail for suspicion of felony arson. His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer.\n\nSargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a \u201csanctuary county\u201d in May 2014. The county only cooperates with \u201cICE holds\u201d if the prisoner has been convicted of a felony or any misdemeanor offence that falls within the Trust Act within the last five years. Mr. Gonzalez\u2019s immigration status has not yet been announced.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union argues detainers are a violation of \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures\u201d under the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Fourth Amendment.\n\nThe Sonoma County Sheriff Department\u2019s \u201c1.0 Policy Statement\u201d reads: \u201cNo person shall be held solely on the basis of their immigration status.\u201d The policy adds that \u201cthe immigration status of a person, and the lack of immigration documentation, should have no bearing on the manner in which Sheriff\u2019s Office personnel execute their duties.\u201d\n\nAccording to ICE documents, Sonoma County declined 491 detainer requests in 2014 and 2015. During the 2017 period from January 28 through February 3, when President Donald Trump issued his immigration Executive Order 13768 to require all federal, state and local government to comply with ICE detainers, Sonoma County still denied detainers.\n\nSonoma County fires have killed dozens. 172 are still missing and 102,000 residents have been dislocated \u2014 about one-fifth of the entire population. The latest financial losses include 3,819 unincorporated parcels with 100 structures valued at $2,016,962,239, and 2,907 homes and 86 commercial units lost in the city of Santa Rosa valued at $1.18 billion.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171017143208im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-17-at-11.35.39-200x150.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017143208im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/10/More-Wine-Country-fires-Getty.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017143208im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17674108&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017143208im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/09/dt-200x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017143208im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/08/Trump-Stares-at-McConnell-Pablo-Martinez-MonsivaisAP--200x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017143208im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/06/U.S.-Mexico-border-wall-reuters-200x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017143208im_/https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=l2Y7o1IW1810vg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017143208im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/04/wi/ap_roger-goodell-rahm-emanuel_ap-photo-1-e1508239987125-200x149.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017143208im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/10/NFL-Ready-200x150.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017143208im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-dcxh5b8qxvs6g.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017143208im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/10/HarveyReachPGA-200x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017143208im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/10/Fonda1016b-200x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017143208im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/10/US-Immigration-John-Moore\u2014Getty-Images-200x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017143208im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/10/wi/afp/17/1tqlrkg-200x143.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017143208im_/http://www.breitbart.com/t/assets/i/store/leader/v2/closed1.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017143208im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/10/More-Wine-Country-fires-Getty-640x480.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017143208im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/10/Schweizer1017-200x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017143208im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/10/Mandalay-Bay-security-vehicle-las-vegas-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017143208im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=296280873867140&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017143208im_/http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/10/More-Wine-Country-fires-Getty.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chriss W.
