A recent 2015 state-wide study revealed that more than 60% of adults aged 21 and higher have tried crystal meth at least once and close to 40% of respondents believed crystal meth should be decriminalized as a schedule 2 drug for medical use in treatment.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20160123155701im_/http://cdn.notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/police-missouri.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160123155701im_/http://cdn.notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lottery-winner-killed-300x170.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160123155701im_/http://notallowedto.com/background-1.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160123155701im_/http://cdn2.notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/us-afghan-drugs-300x170.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160123155701im_/http://cdn2.notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/babysitter-on-drugs.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160123155701im_/http://cdn2.notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Man-tries-to-attack-300x170.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160123155701im_/http://cdn2.notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/logo-2.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160123155701im_/http://cdn1.notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/cheating-wife-caught-1-300x170.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160123155701im_/http://cdn3.notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/angels-300x170.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160123155701im_/http://cdn.notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Man-tries-implanting-tennis-ball-300x170.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160123155701im_/http://cdn2.notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/babysitter-on-drugs.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["George Allan"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160123155701/http://notallowedto.com/babysitter-on-drug-eats-toddler/", "title": "Babysitter on Crystal Meth Eats 3-Month-Old Baby", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Babysitter on Crystal Meth Eats 3-Month-Old Baby", "description": "De Soto, Missouri \u2013 Parents of a three-month old baby were horrified to discover their babysitter had turned into a crystal meth-smoking cannibal when they found the remains of their child cooked in the microwave.
