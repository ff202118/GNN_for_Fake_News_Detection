{"url": "http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/25/13748226/cnn-accidentally-airs-porn-fake-news-boston", "text": "Last night, a twitter account by the name of @solikearose tweeted out a surprising image of CNN broadcasting porn instead of Anthony Bourdain\u2019s scheduled show Parts Unknown. And then without really much questioning, a bunch of news sites ran with it, claiming that the network showed the footage for about 30 minutes. Here are some screenshots grabbed by Mediaite.\n\nFact-checking largely didn\u2019t begin until the stories were published. The @solikearose account has since turned private, and there don\u2019t seem to be any reports of porn airing on CNN last night. RCN also released statements on twitter saying there is no evidence that porn was aired last night in Boston, where @solikearose is supposedly based. \"We are in the process of researching this incident but see no evidence our CNN network feed was compromised last evening in Boston,\" Jeff Carlson, SVP and general manager of RCN Boston, said in a statement to multiple outlets.\n\nCNN has also released a statement: \u201cThe RCN cable operator in Boston aired inappropriate content for 30 minutes on CNN last night. CNN has asked for an explanation.\u201d But that still doesn\u2019t really verify that anything occurred.\n\nThe appeal of the story is obvious: a network news may have aired porn for a full 30 minutes. Hilarious! And the CNN program that was supposed to be on was Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown. It\u2019s a layup for body-part puns.\n\nThis is exactly how fake news spreads\n\nBut this is exactly how fake news spreads. Even if porn was aired on CNN, it\u2019s clear that a lot of publications ran with a story based on tweets from one person before verifying the facts. Many of the headlines already implicate CNN, claiming the channel aired 30 minutes of porn without giving any context.", "images": ["https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1024x768/2400x1600/filters:focal(512x384:513x385):format(webp)/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7534089/drudgesiren.jpg", "http://www.theverge.com/icons/native-ad-placeholder.png", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sWx_F4M-7G8ebcLoTH2RSWM5mYc=/0x0:1024x768/1200x628/filters:focal(512x384:513x385)/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7534089/drudgesiren.jpg", "https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1024x768/2400x2400/filters:focal(512x384:513x385):format(webp)/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7534089/drudgesiren.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6UcWgZtFXCmdzv9GEy32XGQZlLU=/0x0:600xNaN/600x0/filters:focal(300xNaN:301xNaN)/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7533931/cnns_channel_accidentally_broadcast_hardcore_porn.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-dCsSow1Pl4rxlWndRVZlGa3JuE=/0x0:552xNaN/552x0/filters:focal(276xNaN:277xNaN)/cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7533929/Screen_Shot_2016_11_25_at_10.33.00_AM.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sWx_F4M-7G8ebcLoTH2RSWM5mYc=/0x0:1024x768/1200x628/filters:focal(512x384:513x385)/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7534089/drudgesiren.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Loren Grush"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/25/13748226/cnn-accidentally-airs-porn-fake-news-boston", "title": "The CNN porn scare is how fake news spreads", "meta_data": {"description": "The Verge is about technology and how it makes us feel.
