Ms. McCrummen was convicted of a crime punishable by up to six months of imprisonment for writing a hot check that was deemed worthless.\n\nMs. McCrummen\u2019s other offenses are all traffic related and in 2010, she was tracked down by the courts after she had escaped Arizona\u2019s jurisdiction to D.C., and her case was assigned to the Fines/Fees and Restitution Enforcement (FARE) Program established to collect delinquent court ordered restitution, fines, fees, and surcharges . After the FARE team tracked her down at her Washington D.C. apartment, they finally appeared to get her attention and on October 23, 2010 she paid the defaulted fine to the criminal court, almost two months after her conviction. McCrummen has now found herself a four-time loser in the states\u2019 criminal courts. She currently resides outside of the jurisdiction of the three states where she committed her crimes.\n\nSean Hannity ripped into the media frenzy over the Judge Moore scandal on his show last night. The left is calling for his head today:\n\n.@seanhannity EVERYONE deserves the presumption of innocence before proven guilty. Not to mention these allegations coming out days before an election!#RoyMooreChildMolester pic.twitter.com/SEAC7GP0TU \u2014 Shell Covfefe\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@MichelleRMed) November 10, 2017\n\nWhen a reporter has a criminal history that essentially proves she gave false information to pay a debt or for services, shouldn\u2019t her character come into question when it comes to making a 40 year old sexual allegation against one of the most hated, Steve Bannon backed conservatives running for office in America, that may help to enhance her career?", "images":
