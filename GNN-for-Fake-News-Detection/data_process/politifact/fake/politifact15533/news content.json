Mohamed then crashed into a house.\n\nThe man pushing the stroller was identified as 23-year-old Kenan Ferebee, and the child was his 7-month-old son, Micah.\n\nThe baby was pronounced dead at an area hospital. The child\u2019s father was taken to a different hospital in critical condition, WBNS reported.\n\nA witness said Mohamed had a phone in her hand at the time of the crash, but there was no evidence of any texts or calls being received at the time. Four days earlier, the woman was in an accident in which she crashed into a median, The Columbus Dispatch reported. In both cases, she was driving on a temporary permit without an accompanying licensed driver.\n\n\u201cNot one of those single things amounts to recklessness,\u201d Judge Laurel Beatty Blunt said. \u201cBut when you look at the totality of the circumstances, the court does rule that it does amount to reckless conduct.\u201d\n\nMohamed, a native of Somalia, reportedly faced a prison sentence if convicted, but was allowed to remain free until her sentencing.\n\n\u201cIf an American did the same thing they would be in jail for a long time,\u201d one Mad World News reader commented on the site\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cShe should get the same or more being the 2nd accident in 4 days. Going off the side of the road and running over 2 innocent people killing a helpless baby. Come on people. Give her life in prison. She deserves more than that but I\u2019m sure she won\u2019t get the death penalty. What in the hell kind of Justice system do we have now.\u201d\n\n\u201cDefine for me the difference between reckless conduct and recklessness,\u201d another wrote. \u201cMaybe in OHIO they speak different English than I do, after all I am from a rural state and may not understand the high English as interpreted by more citified judges. Where is justice? If a Caucasian teenager did this\u2026 You finish the sentence.\u201d", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180616235755im_/http://cdn.dailyheadlines.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ruling-1000x600.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180616235755im_/http://cdn.dailyheadlines.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/001DailyHeadlinesLogoDesign1.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180616235755im_/http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=49f0a611dfeee30a349d172abf162f34&size=40", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180616235755im_/https://politicalmayhem.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/westervilleaccident.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180616235755im_/https://politicalmayhem.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen_Shot_2017-10-16_at_11.33.18_AM.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180616235755im_/http://cdn.dailyheadlines.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ruling-1000x600.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tinker Belle"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180616235755/http://dailyheadlines.net/burka-clad-woman-runs-over-baby-gets-away-with-crime-for-1-stunning-reason/", "title": "Burka Clad Woman Runs Over Baby, Gets Away With Crime For 1 Stunning Reason", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "og": {"image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180616235755im_/http://cdn.dailyheadlines.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ruling-1000x600.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "After 2 car accidents in 4 days, one of which injured a father and took the life of his 7-month old baby before the car drove into a house, a Somali native has been arrested, charged, and convicted of aggravated vehicular homicide and was then let free to roam around until her sentencing hearing.
