{"url": "http://www.worldfactsftw.com/nasa-will-pay-you/", "text": "Poker is a card game that has a long and rich history. Its roots stretch back nearly 1,000 years and it has crossed several cultures. Some claim that it descends from a 10th-century Chinese domino game, while others suggest that it was inspired by the 17th-century French card game called poque. Regardless, poker is a card game that has become an integral part of modern society.\n\nThe game has many variants but Texas Hold\u2019em is probably the most popular. In this variant two cards are dealt to each player, which are known as their hole cards. Five community cards are then revealed in stages. This happens in three betting intervals or rounds. The first round involves a single card, referred to as the flop; the second includes another single card known as the turn; and the third and final stage reveals the fifth community card called the river.\n\nEach time a new round begins one player puts chips into the pot. The players to their left must either call that bet or raise it by putting more chips into the pot than the amount raised by the player before them. The player can also fold. If they fold, they forfeit their hand and are out of the betting.\n\nWhile a good portion of the poker game is decided by what cards you\u2019re dealt, it\u2019s important to focus as much on your opponent\u2019s moves as you are on your own. This will help you to read your opponent\u2019s body language and determine what type of hands they have. It will also allow you to determine how strong your own hand is and how to play it.\n\nAs you learn more about poker, it\u2019s a good idea to study some of the less-popular variations. This will allow you to expand your playing horizons and maybe even impress some friends with your knowledge of these other games.\n\nOne of the most fundamental things to learn about poker is how to bet correctly. Often times poker beginners call too much and risk losing a lot of money. When it\u2019s your turn to act, you should only bet when you think that your hand is a winner. If you have a weak hand, it\u2019s better to pass on the bet than to make a big bet that will cause your opponents to fold.\n\nPosition is also vital to a winning poker strategy. As the game progresses, you will be able to figure out what your opponents have and how to make them play their hand. You will also be able to make more accurate value bets when you\u2019re in late position. This is because you will have more information about the strength of your opponent\u2019s hand than when you\u2019re in early position. This will make it easier for you to bluff when needed and increase your chances of making a good hand. The more you practice, the more you\u2019ll be able to make these crucial adjustments.", "images": ["https://i.imgur.com/7lw2EYB.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/iZjgpxf.png", "https://i.imgur.com/D8g5zBs.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/TCWi4Yy.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/ppF0YZu.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/kRTDQGS.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/Om9x5ay.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/AXQXHbp.jpg", "https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6rMovCbCg7s/XrkOelVEH2I/AAAAAAAABo4/h9UOtl-9XHkkdo8BydwNBWhBlU747pHcgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/slider-dewi4d-B1.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/f4W62Xc.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/cy4njAg.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/gqQ0Y8q.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/5vvfXNN.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/PFnr9Jh.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/bw3eUbM.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/BfdueEA.png", "https://i.imgur.com/LfMx3qW.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/X8J0KZp.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/dQSM7cI.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/nEf2Ljk.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/wlFeEuD.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/37Hsohd.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/6ZuoD0R.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/xFqbmAF.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/tHjOJM7.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/4af2FXo.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/VxnBdGa.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/BtfgGTf.png", "https://i.imgur.com/q9ZhfyF.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/AeeBMe9.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/Co877fc.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/tyPSfl8.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/zBmUJLh.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/lsE3kn4.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/5XzKZKl.png", "https://i.imgur.com/KKHdnl2.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/TV0Xlxu.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/n6CBj50.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/78MUYvC.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/0ofuyNW.jpg", "https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiEIZzT0HznQnhPKwc3vBW_ti7iYOKc_ipur4_obDtemfLBhpWHmJV9PVA-5ElIlcWiYzwrRw5UW1QtF5w3wwFisBDWdPJR4UQjkLT6iG-CuDu_mLkb8O_MDNSzbvJ0Jiw-bvyICM9pB4KrZ-ZqvOffQe5ABxYw1FmAUZICrDfAfK7uzFGKufE6uPD6hmtF/s1600/dewi4d-1.jpg", "https://i.ibb.co/prvGMgC/capsatoto-bandar-togel-online-terpercaya-via-pulsa.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/em2cHqV.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/ULf4Hsc.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/XVOu9VI.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/NZoXSix.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/ZlzuqH0.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/IcomUiL.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/y3s2mE9.jpg", "https://www.labourpains.com/img/slider19.webp", "https://i.imgur.com/2EAY3di.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/R24fD2C.jpg", "https://cdn2.softswiss.net/platincasino/i/s3/pragmaticexternal/BigBassHalloween.webp", "https://i.imgur.com/OWrroWd.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/ysiguH0.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/xURYrjx.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/zV1KUjC.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/T4GMKBH.jpg", "https://friendsandfamilybaltimore.com/img/vs20fruitsw.webp", "https://i.imgur.com/ux757Sn.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1t+WTX1RqL.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/RyTIG3E.jpg", "https://taruhanonline101.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/online-gaming-slot-machine-system.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/XbUVWdA.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/wWCNCUI.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/GE9tXYQ.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/eTp39NC.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/jbjYFvF.jpg", "https://duncanst.com/img/situs-slot-gacor.webp", "https://i.imgur.com/IULgEGJ.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/UdoMUiY.png", "https://i.imgur.com/QKckfhm.png", "https://www.digitalsummer.net/img/jeniustoto.webp", "https://i.imgur.com/RjQFqsc.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/L452q7G.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/EIfFRPw.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/FOnwCgx.jpg"], "top_img": "https://i.imgur.com/PFnr9Jh.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://worldfactsftw.com/", "title": "Just another WordPress site", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Just another WordPress site", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "google-site-verification": "4GTucVlc69GYJkz5J3I7k8nf2aGyyJHONZjSChicDi4", "generator": "WordPress 6.2.4", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "worldfactsftw - Just another WordPress site", "type": "website", "title": "worldfactsftw - Just another WordPress site", "description": "Just another WordPress site", "url": "https://worldfactsftw.com/"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "title": "worldfactsftw - Just another WordPress site", "description": "Just another WordPress site"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.worldfactsftw.com", "summary": ""}
